# Community-DDOS-Against-Scammers
Join a community that does distributed denial of service against scam websites.

You load a little program on your computer and you join a large community, then you watch spammers and scammers die.

An ethical community distributed denial of service destroys their operation.

The first step is a warning to their ISP, and IANA that they are scammers.
If the ISP and other parties do not act in time.
The entire user base performs a distributed denial of service attack on the website or email service.

The list is formed by multiple listing across the many service that track and log these online assholes.

The user pushes update and a new list is sent.

Who is it against:

* Spammers, the email service they use to spam.
* Scammers, the website they use to scam.
* Payment processors of the scammers.
* Domain registrars of the scammer websites.
* IP's that DDOS and hack for no reason.
* Other pests and idiots.

Take back the internet. Ethical DDOS
